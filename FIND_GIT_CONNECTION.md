# 🔍 Finding Git Connection Option

Since you created the project via CLI, the Git connection option might be in a different location.

## Try These Locations:

### Option 1: General Section (Most Likely)
1. On the Settings tab, scroll down to the **"General"** section
2. Look for:
   - "Git repository" or "Repository" 
   - "Connect repository" button
   - "Source" or "Source control" option
   - Any option mentioning "Git" or "GitHub"

### Option 2: Top of Deployments Tab
1. Go back to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Look at the top near the "Create deployment" button
3. There might be a "Connect to Git" or "Set up Git" link

### Option 3: Project Settings Alternative
The Git connection might be in the General section under "Production branch" - there might be an option to connect the repository there.

## If You Still Can't Find It:

If the "Connect to Git" option is not visible, it might be because:
- The project was created via CLI (which we did)
- Some Cloudflare accounts/projects require creating a new project to connect Git

**Alternative Solution**: We can create a new project directly connected to Git, or check if there's a different workflow for CLI-created projects.

**Please tell me what you see in the "General" section** - especially look for any mention of "Git", "Repository", or "Source".

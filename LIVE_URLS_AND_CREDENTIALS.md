# 🔗 Live URLs & Credentials

## 📍 Expected Live URLs

Based on your Firebase project `uniscrapper-pro`, here are your URLs:

### Frontend URL
**https://uniscrapper-pro.web.app**

### Backend API URL
**https://us-central1-uniscrapper-pro.cloudfunctions.net/api**

### Health Check
**https://us-central1-uniscrapper-pro.cloudfunctions.net/api/health**

## 🔑 Firebase Configuration (Already Set)

Your Firebase config is already in `firebase.ts`:

```javascript
{
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC1xJoHny4C7ViqpUTW0MY8rAhk1M8Y2xw",
  authDomain: "uniscrapper-pro.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "uniscrapper-pro",
  storageBucket: "uniscrapper-pro.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "921601102504",
  appId: "1:921601102504:web:ed1cdffe7b0c998901289d"
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**The URLs above are ready, but the application needs to be deployed first!**

Currently:
- ✅ Hosting site exists (but not deployed yet)
- ❌ Functions not deployed yet
- ❌ Frontend not built/deployed yet

## 🚀 To Make It Live NOW

I can deploy it right now! Would you like me to:

1. Initialize Firebase locally
2. Deploy Functions
3. Build and deploy Frontend
4. Give you the working live URLs

**Just say "deploy now" and I'll do it!** 🚀

## 📝 After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll have:
- ✅ Live frontend at: `https://uniscrapper-pro.web.app`
- ✅ Working API at: `https://us-central1-uniscrapper-pro.cloudfunctions.net/api`
- ✅ Health check endpoint

**No additional credentials needed** - Firebase handles authentication automatically!
